# MEAM-510-Lab4

This is the repository for MEAM-510 Lab4

Andrew Hou, Yuchen Guo and Yupeng Li are working as a team on this project.

Right now it is still under construction.

In short, we are building a race car project using ESP32 chip. The code would include WiFi communication and DC motor driving.

That's basically it for now
